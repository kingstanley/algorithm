Given a position of a white bishop and a black pawn on a standard chess board, determine whether the bishop can capture the pawn in one move. The bishop has no restriction on distance for each move but its limited to diagonal movement.

Example:
For bishop = a1 and c3, the output should be bishopAndPawn(bishop, pawn) = true
