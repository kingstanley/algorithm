Call two arms equally strong if the maximum weights they each are able to lift are equal.

Call two people equally strong if their strongest arms are equally strong(The strongest arm can be both the right and the wright) and so are their weakest arms.

Given you and your friend arms lifting capabilities determine if you two are equally strong

Example:
For yourRight = 15, yourLeft = 10, friendLeft = 15, friendRight = 10; the output should be areEquallyStrong(yourRight, yourLeft, friendRight, friendLeft) = true;

For yourRight = 10, yourLeft = 15, friendLeft = 10, friendRight = 15; the output should be areEquallyStrong(yourRight, yourLeft, friendRight, friendLeft) = true;
For yourRight = 10, yourLeft = 15, friendLeft = 9, friendRight = 15; the output should be areEquallyStrong(yourRight, yourLeft, friendRight, friendLeft) = false;
