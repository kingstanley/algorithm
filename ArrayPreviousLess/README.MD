Given an array of integers, for each position i, search among the previous positions for the last (from the left) position that contains a smaller value. Store this value at position i in the answer. if no such value can be found store -1 instead

Example:
For inputArray = [3,5,2,4,5] the output should be arrayPreviousLess(inputArray)= [-1,3,-1,2,4]
