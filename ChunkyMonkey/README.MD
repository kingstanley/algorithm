Write a function that splits an array (first argument) into group the length of size of (second argument) and return them as two dimessional array;

Example
chunkyMonkey(['a','b','c','d'],2), should return [["a", "b"],["c","d"]]
chunkeyMonkey([0,1,2,3,4,5],4) should return [[0,1,2,3],[4,5]]

Hint
slice()
