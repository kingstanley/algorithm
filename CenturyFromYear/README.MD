Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century starts from 1 up to and including the year 100, the second from the year 101 to 200. etc

Example:
For year = 1905, the output should be centuryFromYear(year) = 20;
For year = 1700, the output should be centuryFromYear(year) = 17;

Hint:
Math.floor()
