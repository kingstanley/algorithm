Given an array of integers a, find an integer x from such that the value of
abs(a[0]-x) + abs(a[1]-x)+ ... +abs(a.[length - 1] - x)

is the smallest possible(here abs denote the absolute value) if there were several values output the smallest one

Example:
for a = [2,4,7] the output should be absoluteValueSumMinimization(a) = 4;
for a = [2,4,7,6] the output should be absoluteValueSumMinimization(a) = 4;
